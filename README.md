## My process

Similar to other projects I used the design images to build a mock up of the structure I need to apply to ensure a semantic markup and layout. This will be my first time building an accodian from scratch so this will require some research on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/).

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

In this project I have learned that using both the "details" and " summary" elements reduces
the code needed for this pattern.

### Useful resources

- [&#60;details&#62;&#58; The Details disclosure element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details)
- [ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/accordion/examples/accordion/)
